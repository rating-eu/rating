There is a great disparity between the efficiency of attacks and inadequate defences, partly due to the lack of quantitative information for decision makers to prioritise security investments. Fostering a culture of risk management, Hermeneut provides individual organisations as well as business sectors with an innovative methodology to assess their vulnerabilities and corresponding tangible and intangible assets at risk.",
