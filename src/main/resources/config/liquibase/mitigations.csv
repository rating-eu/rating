1;Antivirus;Anti-virus software is a software utility that detects, prevents, and removes viruses, worms, and other malware from a computer. Most anti-virus programs include an auto-update feature that permits the program to download profiles f new viruses, enabling the system to check for new threats. Antivirus programs are essential utilities for any computer but the choice of which one is very important. One AV program might find a certain virus or worm while another cannot, or vice-versa.;now();now()
2;IDS/IPS;An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a type of security software designed to automatically alert administrators when someone or something is trying to compromise information system through malicious activities or through security policy violations. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is a system that monitors a network for malicious activities such as security threats or policy violations. The main function of an IPS is to identify suspicious activity, and then log information, attempt to block the activity, and then finally to report it.;now();now()
3;Firewall/UTM;A firewall is software used to maintain the security of a private network. Firewalls block unauthorized access to or from private networks and are often employed to prevent unauthorized Web users or illicit software from gaining access to private networks connected to the Internet. A firewall may be implemented using hardware, software, or a combination of both.;now();now()
4;Awareness;Cyber-security Awareness Campaigns and multi-channel Training of the employees and operators.  Training can be delievered through frontal courses, e-learning interactive packages, serious gaming techniques or on-the-job.;now();now()
5;Secure Coding;Secure coding is the practice of writing a source code or a code base that is compatible with the best security principles for a given system and interface;now();now()
6;Hardening;Hardening refers to providing various means of protection in a computer system. Protection is provided in various layers and is often referred to as defense in depth. Protecting in layers means to protect at the host level, the application level, the operating system level, the user level, the physical level and all the sublevels in between. Each level requires a unique method of security.;now();now()
7;VA/Penetration testing;Specific Vulnerabilities Assessment can also include human aspects and assess the socio-technical system''s vulnerabilities with respect to Social Engineering attacks.;now();now()
8;SIEM/Log Collection;Security incident and event management (SIEM) is the process of identifying, monitoring, recording and analyzing security events or incidents within a real-time IT environment. It provides a comprehensive and centralized view of the security scenario of an IT infrastructure.;now();now()
9;Anti-Spam;Anti-spam refers to services and solutions that focus on blocking and mitigating the effects of illegal emails – or spam – on email users. To achieve this objective, different types of anti-spam systems have been integrated with the email systems of many email and Internet service providers (ISP). This solution however is nowadays not enough and organizations often install in-house anti-spam systems in a layered strategy against spam and phishing.;now();now()
10;Strong Authentication;Strong authentication blends a minimum of two different authentication factors of different types to improve the safety of identity verification. Passwords tend not to present an ample level of security for systems that store or process the data elements defined as restricted. Although passwords are intuitive, they are prone to a multitude of attacks and weak spots such as impersonation, guessing, observing, snooping, borrowing, and dictionary attacks. Therefore, strong authentication techniques are required to minimize the risk involving these high-value systems. Implementing two authentication factors of distinct types instead of one provides an advanced level of authentication assurance.;now();now()
11;DLP;Data loss prevention (DLP) refers to the identification and monitoring of sensitive data to ensure that it''s only accessed by authorized users and that there are safeguards against data leaks.;now();now()
12;Web Application Firewall;A web application firewall (WAF) protects web application servers and infrastructure from attacks and breaches originating from the Internet and external networks. It is a purpose-built firewall that can be customized to accept and reject HTTP requests and sessions using predefined rules.;now();now()
13;Surveillance;Surveillance refers to the physical actions taken to monitor physical areas of an organisation, using different methods. For example IP surveillance. It is an Internet-based alternative to closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring. Through the use of IP-connected cameras, companies and individuals can monitor a physical area in ways that were not possible previously.;now();now()
14;Advanced Behaviour Detection;User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) is a type of machine learning model that can help to foil cyberattackers by discovering security anomalies. UEBA uses advanced analysis, aggregates data from logs and reports, and looks at packet, flow, file and other types of information, as well as certain kinds of threat data to figure out whether certain kinds of activity and behavior are likely to constitute a cyberattack. Network behavior anomaly detection (NBAD) is the real-time monitoring of a network for any unusual activity, trends or events. The network behavior anomaly detection tools are used as additional threat detection tools to monitor network activities and generate general alerts that often require further evaluation by the IT team.;now();now()
15;Backup;Backup refers to the process of making copies of data or data files to use in the event the original data or data files are lost or destroyed. Secondarily, a backup may refer to making copies for historical purposes, such as for longitudinal studies, statistics or for historical records or to meet the requirements of a data retention policy.;now();now()
16;Security Policy Framework;Information security policy is a set of policies issued by an organization to ensure that all information technology users within the domain of the organization or its networks comply with rules and guidelines related to the security of the information stored digitally at any point in the network or within the organization''s boundaries of authority. Every organization needs to protect its data and also control how it should be distributed both within and without the organizational boundaries. This may mean that information may have to be encrypted, authorized through a third party or institution and may have restrictions placed on its distribution with reference to a classification system laid out in the information security policy.;now();now()
17;ISP DOS Protection;Distributed denial of service (DDoS) prevention refers to the collective tools, processes and methodologies that enable a network, information system or IT environment to be protected from DDoS attacks and intrusions. It is a security and hardening technique that ensures that optimal or normal computing operations continue even under a DDoS attack.;now();now()
18;Data Classification;Data classification is the process of sorting and categorizing data into various types, forms or any other distinct class. Data classification enables the separation and classification of data according to data set requirements for various business or personal objectives. It is mainly a data management process.;now();now()
19;Data Encryption;Data Encryption enables the encryption of the content of a data object, file, network packet or application, so that it is secure and unviewable by unauthorized users. Encryption software encrypts data or files by working with one or more encryption algorithms. Security personnel use it to protect data from being viewed by unauthorized users. Encryption solutions are available at any layer of the security, from networking to applications.;now();now()
20;Patching;Patch management is a strategy for managing patches or upgrades for software applications and technologies. A patch management plan can help a business or organization handle these changes efficiently. Software patches are often necessary in order to fix existing problems with software that are noticed after the initial release. Many of these patches have to do with security. Others may have to do with specific functionality for programs.;now();now()
21;DR;A disaster recovery site (DR site) is an alternative backup facility, usually IT in nature, that is used when a primary location becomes unusable due to failure or disaster. It contains equipment and infrastructure that can be temporarily used to manage business processes until the main site''s functionality is fully restored.;now();now()
22;IAM/SSO;Identity and access management (IAM) is the process used in businesses and organizations to grant or deny employees and others authorization to secure systems. IAM is an integration of work flow systems that involves organizational think tanks who analyze and make security systems work effectively. Policies, procedures, protocols and processes are all linked to IAM. Identity and security applications are also important considerations. IAM verifies user access requests and either grants or denies permission to protected company materials. It also deals with various administrative functions including password problems, and helps oversees employee identity management. Standards and applications of IAM include the maintenance of user life cycles, various application accesses and singular logons. Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. SSO is a common procedure in enterprises, where a client accesses multiple resources connected to a local area network (LAN).;now();now()
23;Early Warning/Thread Intelligence;Threat intelligence is the analysis of internal and external threats to an organization in a systematic way. The treats that threat intelligence attempts to defend against include zero-day threats, exploits and advanced persistent threats (APTs). Threat intelligence involves in-depth analysis of both internal and external threats. Threat intelligence is also known as cyber threat intelligence (CTI).;now();now()
24;SOC;A security operations center (SOC) is a centralized unit that deals with security issues on an organizational and technical level. A SOC within a building or facility is a central location from where staff supervises the site, using data processing technology. A network operations center (NOC) is a central location from which network administrators manage, control and monitor one or more networks. The overall function is to maintain optimal network operations across a variety of platforms, mediums and communications channels.;now();now()
25;Physical Access Control;Physical access control limits people access to specific buildings, rooms and physical IT assets (computers, servers, medical devices, etc.) by checking people identity and authorisations and performing additional security screenings on people.;now();now()
26;Secure Network Protocol (https, vpn ...);Network security protocols are a type network protocol that ensures the security and integrity of data in transit over a network connection.
