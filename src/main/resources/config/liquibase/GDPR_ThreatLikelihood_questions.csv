2001;Is any part of the processing of personal data performed through the internet?;When the processing of personal data is performed fully or partially through the open Internet, possible threats from external online attackers increase (e.g. Denial of Service, SQL injection, Man-in-the-Middle attacks), especially when the service is available (and, thus, traceable/known) to all internet users.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;1;NETWORK_AND_TECHNICAL_RESOURCES;3
2002;Is it possible to provide access to an internal personal data processing system through the internet (e.g. for certain users or groups of users)?;When access to an internal data processing system is provided through the internet, the likelihood of external threats increases (e.g. due to external online attackers). At the same time the likelihood of (accidental or intentional) misuse of data by the users also increases (e.g. accidental disclosure of personal data when working in public spaces). Special attention should be given to cases where remote management/administration of the IT system is allowed.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;2;NETWORK_AND_TECHNICAL_RESOURCES;3
2003;Is the personal data processing system interconnected to another external or internal (to your organization) IT system or service?;Connection to external IT systems may introduce additional threats due to the threats (and potential security flaws) that are inherent to those systems. The same applies also to internal systems, taking into account that, if not appropriately configured, such connections may allow access (to the personal data) to more persons within the organization (which are not in principle authorized for such access).;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;3;NETWORK_AND_TECHNICAL_RESOURCES;3
2004;Can unauthorized individuals easily access the data processing environment?;Although focus has been put on electronic systems and services, the physical environment (relevant to these systems and services) is an important aspect that, if not adequately safeguarded, can seriously compromise security (e.g. by allowing unauthorized parties to gain physical access to the IT equipment and network components or failing to provide protection of the computer room in the event of a physical disaster).;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;4;NETWORK_AND_TECHNICAL_RESOURCES;3
2005;Is the personal data processing system designed, implemented or maintained without following relevant best practices?;Poorly designed, implemented and/or maintained hardware and software components can pose serious risks to information security. To this end, good or best practices accumulate the experience of prior events and can be regarded as practical guidelines of how to avoid exposure and achieve certain levels of resilience.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;5;NETWORK_AND_TECHNICAL_RESOURCES;3
2101;Are the roles and responsibilities with regard to personal data processing vague or not clearly defined?;When roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined, access (and further processing) of personal data may be uncontrolled, resulting to unauthorized use of resources and compromising the overall security of the system.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;1;PROCEDURES_RELATED_TO_THE_PROCESSING_OF_PERSONAL_DATA;3
2102;Is the acceptable use of the network, system and physical resources within the organization ambiguous or not clearly defined;When acceptable use of resources is not clearly mandated, security threats might arise due to misunderstanding or intentional misuse of the system. The clear definition of policies for network, system and physical resources can reduce potential risks.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;2;PROCEDURES_RELATED_TO_THE_PROCESSING_OF_PERSONAL_DATA;3
2103;Are the employees allowed to bring and use their own devices to connect to the personal data processing system?;Employees using their personal devices within the organization could increase the risk of data leakage or unauthorized access to the information system. Moreover, as devices are not centrally controlled, they may introduce additional bugs or viruses into the system.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;3;PROCEDURES_RELATED_TO_THE_PROCESSING_OF_PERSONAL_DATA;3
2104;Are employees allowed to transfer, store or otherwise process personal data outside the premises of the organization?;Processing of personal data outside the premises of the organization can offer a lot of flexibility, but at the same time introduces additional risks, both related to the transmission of information through possibly insecure network channels (e.g. open Wi-Fi networks), as well as unauthorised use of this information.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;4;PROCEDURES_RELATED_TO_THE_PROCESSING_OF_PERSONAL_DATA;3
2105;Can personal data processing activities be carried out without log files being created?;The lack of appropriate logging and monitoring mechanisms can increase intentional or accidental abuse of processes/procedures and resources, resulting to the subsequent abuse of personal data. ;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;5;PROCEDURES_RELATED_TO_THE_PROCESSING_OF_PERSONAL_DATA;3
2201;Is the processing of personal data performed by a non-defined number of employees?;When access (and further processing) of personal data is open to a large number of employees, the possibilities of abuse due to human factor increase. Clearly defining who really needs to access the data and limiting access only to those persons can contribute to the security of personal data.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;1;PEOPLE_INVOLVED_IN_THE_PROCESSING_OF_PERSONAL_DATA;3
2202;Is any part of the data processing operation performed by a contractor/third party (data processor)?;When the processing is performed by external contractors, the organization may lose partially the control over these data. Moreover, additional security threats may be introduced due to the threats that are inherent to these contractors. It is important for the organization to select contractors that can offer a high level of security and to clearly define what part of the processing is assigned to them, maintaining as much as possible a high level of control.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;2;PEOPLE_INVOLVED_IN_THE_PROCESSING_OF_PERSONAL_DATA;3
2203;Are the obligations of the parties/persons involved in personal data processing ambiguous or not clearly stated?;When employees are not clearly informed about their obligations, threats from accidental misuse (e.g. disclosure or destruction) of data many significantly increase. ;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;3;PEOPLE_INVOLVED_IN_THE_PROCESSING_OF_PERSONAL_DATA;3
2204;Is personnel involved in the processing of personal data unfamiliar with information security matters?;When employees are not aware of the need of applying security measures, they can accidentally pose further threats to the system. Training can greatly contribute to making employees aware both of their data protection obligations, as well as the application of specific security measures.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;4;PEOPLE_INVOLVED_IN_THE_PROCESSING_OF_PERSONAL_DATA;3
2205;Do persons/parties involved in the data processing operation neglect to securely store and/or destroy personal data?;Many personal data breaches occur due to the lack of physical protection measures, such as locks and secure destruction systems. Paper based files are usually part of the input or the output of an information system, can contain personal data and should also be protected from unauthorized disclosure and re-use.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;5;PEOPLE_INVOLVED_IN_THE_PROCESSING_OF_PERSONAL_DATA;3
2301;Do you consider your business sector as being prone to cyberattacks?;When security attacks have already taken place in a specific business sector, there is an indication that the organization would probably need to take additional measures to avoid a similar event.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;1;BUSINESS_SECTOR_AND_SCALE_OF_PROCESSING;3
2302;Has your organization suffered any cyberattack or other type of security breach over the last two years?;If the organization has already been attacked or there are indications that this might have been the case, additional measures need to be taken to prevent similar events in the future.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;2;BUSINESS_SECTOR_AND_SCALE_OF_PROCESSING;3
2303;Have you received any notifications and/or complaints with regard to the security of the IT system (used for the processing of personal data) over the last year?;Security bugs/vulnerabilities can be exploited to perform attacks (cyber or physical) to systems and services. Security bulletins containing important information regarding security vulnerabilities that could affect the aforementioned systems and services should be considered.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;3;BUSINESS_SECTOR_AND_SCALE_OF_PROCESSING;3
2304;Does a processing operation concern a large volume of individuals and/or personal data?;The type and volume of personal data (scale) can make the processing operation attractive to attackers (due to the inherent value of these data).;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;4;BUSINESS_SECTOR_AND_SCALE_OF_PROCESSING;3
2305;Are there any security best practices specific to your business sector that have not been adequately followed?;Sector specific security measures are usually adjusted to the needs (and risks) of the particular sector. Lack of compliance with relevant best practices might be an indicator of poor security management.;EN;MULTIPLE_CHOICE;5;BUSINESS_SECTOR_AND_SCALE_OF_PROCESSING;3
