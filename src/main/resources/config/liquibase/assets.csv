1;Cash;Cash on deposit and on hand;now();now();1
2;Certificate of Deposit (CD);A Certificate of Deposit (CD) is an agreement to deposit money for a fixed period with a bank that will pay you interest. You can choose to invest for three months, six months, one year or five years. You will receive a higher interest rate for the longer time commitment. You promise to leave all the money, plus the interest, with the bank for the entire term.;now();now();1
3;Equities;In finance, you can think of equity as one''s degree ownership in any asset after all debts associated with that asset are paid off. For example, a car or house with no outstanding debt is considered entirely the owner''s equity because he or she can readily sell the item for cash, and pocket the resultant sum. Stocks are equity because they represent ownership in a firm, though ownership of shares in a public company generally does not come with accompanying liabilities.;now();now();1
4;Corporate bonds and stock;Stocks and bonds represent two different ways for an entity to raise money to fund or expand their operations. When a company issues stock, it is selling a piece of itself in exchange for cash. When an entity issues a bond, it is issuing debt with the agreement to pay interest for the use of the money.;now();now();1
5;Temporary investments;Temporary investments are securities that can be sold in the near future, and for which there is an expectation of doing so. These investments are commonly used when a business has a short-term excess of funds on which it wants to earn interest, but which will be needed to fund operations within the near future. These types of investments are usually very safe, but also have quite a low rate of return. Temporary investments are classified as current assets on the balance sheet.;now();now();1
6;Insurance premiums;An insurance premium is the amount of money that an individual or business must pay for an insurance policy. The insurance premium is income for the insurance company, once it is earned, and also represents a liability in that the insurer must provide coverage for claims being made against the policy.;now();now();1
7;Raw and Stock Material;Raw Materials are the resources used by a company to produce its finished goods and products. Stock Materials are the total merchandise kept on hand by a merchant, commercial establishment, warehouse, or manufacturer.;now();now();1
8;Land;'Land is real estate or property, minus buildings and equipment, that is designated by fixed spatial boundaries. Land ownership may offer the title holder the right to natural resources on the land. The traditional school of economics dictates that land is a factor of production, along with capital and labor. The sale of land results in capital gain or loss; under IRS tax laws, land is not a depreciable asset.';now();now();2
9;Buildings;Permanent or temporary structurer enclosed within exterior walls and a roof, and including all attached apparatus, equipment, and fixtures that cannot be removed without cutting into ceiling, floors, or walls.;now();now();2
10;Plants and Machinery;A Plant is a building capable of manufacturing goods of all sizes in large quantities to be sold by a business. Plants can be considered either a long term asset if owned by the firm, or both a long term liability if leased or rented. Machinery is defined as a mechanical device or the parts that keep something working.;now();now();2
11;Equipment;Tangible property (other than land or buildings) that is used in the operations of a business. Examples of equipment include devices, machines, tools, and vehicles.;now();now();2
12;Furniture and Office Supplies;Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating (e.g., chairs, stools, and sofas), eating (tables), and sleeping (e.g., beds). Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks), or to store things (e.g., cupboards and shelves).Office supplies are consumables and equipment regularly used in offices by businesses and other organizations, by individuals engaged in written communications, recordkeeping or bookkeeping, janitorial and cleaning, and for storage of supplies or data. The range of items classified as office supplies varies, and typically includes small, expendable, daily use items, consumable products, small machines, higher cost equipment such as computers.;now();now();2
13;Copyright;Copyright guarantees the protection of drawn, written or photographic descriptions of an idea against unauthorized copying or adapting. Unlike patent, copyright rises automatically without fees. However, it does not protect the underlying idea. Nevertheless, copyright may be an effective way of protection for computer code. Copyright arises automatically and is free. It is important because it can easily establish dates of origin of an idea, or of changes to an idea. However, it gives no protection against someone who independently comes up with the same or a similar idea (i.e. a competitor may say that his idea is similar by coincidence, or that others idea is a copy of his).;now();now();3
14;Patent;The patent systems aim to encourage the development of new technologies. A patent offers a legal monopoly granted by government through patent offices in return for public disclosure of innovations and inventions. Observation of the patent literature show that patenting an idea will not necessarily generate additional value for the underlying invention (i.e. if no one is interested on protected invention, a patent is unlikely to make any difference. But if an invention has commercial potential, a patent may ensure a financial benefit). The cost and complexity of patenting can be a problem for many inventors. Therefore, a decision to apply for a patent should never be taken without careful consideration of several factors since patents last for 20 years (under condition of renewal fees payment).;now();now();3
15;Blueprint;Introduced in the 19th century, the blueprint process allowed rapid and accurate reproduction of documents used in construction and industry. A blueprint is a reproduction of a technical drawing (documenting an architecture or an engineering design for example) characterized by light-colored lines on a blue background using a contact print process on light-sensitive sheets.;now();now();3
