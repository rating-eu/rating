1;OSINT;HIGH;LOW;LOW;HIGH;now();now();Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the collection and analysis of information that is gathered from public, or open, sources. OSINT is primarily used in national security, law enforcement, and business intelligence functions and is of value to analysts who use non-sensitive intelligence in answering classified, unclassified, or proprietary intelligence requirements across the previous intelligence disciplines.
2;*SHING;HIGH;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;MEDIUM_HIGH;now();now();Attack patterns within this category focus on the manipulation and exploitation of people. The techniques defined by each pattern are used to convince a target into performing actions or divulging confidential information that benefit the adversary, often resulting in access to computer systems or facilities. While similar to a confidence trick or simple fraud, the term typically applies to trickery or deception for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or computer system access. In most cases, the adversary never comes face-to-face with the victim.
3;Human Behaviour Manipulation;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;now();now();An adversary exploits inherent human psychological predisposition to influence a targeted individual or group to solicit information or manipulate the target into performing an action that serves the adversary''s interests. Many interpersonal social engineering techniques do not involve outright deception, although they can. Many are subtle ways of manipulating a target to remove barriers, make the target feel comfortable, and produce an exchange in which the target is either more likely to share information directly, or let key information slip out unintentionally.
4;Human Targeted Attack;LOW;HIGH;HIGH;LOW;now();now();An adversary engages an individual using any combination of social engineering methods for the purpose of extracting information. Accurate contextual and environmental queues, such as knowing important information about the target company or individual can greatly increase the success of the attack and the quality of information gathered. Authentic mimicry combined with detailed knowledge increases the success of elicitation attacks.
5;Impersonification;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;now();now();Impersonation is one of several social engineering tools used to gain access to a system or network in order to commit fraud, industrial espionage or identity theft. The social engineer impersonates or plays the role of someone you are likely to trust or obey convincingly enough to fool you into allowing access to your office, to information, or to your information systems.
6;Scanning (Footprinting);HIGH;LOW;LOW;HIGH;now();now();An adversary engages in probing and exploration activities to identify constituents and properties of the target. Footprinting is a general term to describe a variety of information gathering techniques, often used by attackers in preparation for some attack. It consists of using tools to learn as much as possible about the composition, configuration, and security mechanisms of the targeted application, system or network.
7;Fuzzing;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;LOW;MEDIUM_HIGH;now();now();In this attack pattern, the adversary leverages fuzzing to try to identify weaknesses in the system. Fuzzing is a software security and functionality testing method that feeds randomly constructed input to the system and looks for an indication that a failure in response to that input has occurred. Fuzzing treats the system as a black box and is totally free from any preconceptions or assumptions about the system. Fuzzing can help an attacker discover certain assumptions made about user input in the system.
8;Protocol Analysis & Abuse;LOW;MEDIUM;LOW;MEDIUM;now();now();An adversary engages in activities to decipher and/or decode protocol information for a network or application communication protocol used for transmitting information between interconnected nodes or systems on a packet-switched data network. While this type of analysis involves the analysis of a networking protocol inherently, it does not require the presence of an actual or physical network. Depending upon the methods used the process may involve observing, interacting, and modifying actual communications occurring between hosts. The goal of protocol analysis is to derive the data transmission syntax, as well as to extract the meaningful content, including packet or content delimiters used by the protocol.
9;Gain a foothold;MEDIUM;LOW;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;now();now();To get a strong position that will allow for improvement later. (Waiting for description)
10;Malware;HIGH;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;MEDIUM_HIGH;now();now();The word Malware is derived from the term ''Malicious Software''. Any piece of software that performs undesirable operations such as data theft or some other type of computer compromise can be categorised as Malware. Malware is a broad term that can refer to various types of malicious programs. […] The main types of Malware, namely: Trojans, Viruses, Worms, and Spyware. The symptoms caused by these different types of malware may sometimes be similar. However, they mainly differ in the way they spread and infect systems.
11;Reverse Engineering;LOW;HIGH;HIGH;LOW;now();now();An adversary discovers the structure, function, and composition of an object, resource, or system by using a variety of analysis techniques to effectively determine how the analysed entity was constructed or operates. The goal of reverse engineering is often to duplicate the function, or a part of the function, of an object in order to duplicate or back engineer some aspect of its functioning. Reverse engineering techniques can be applied to mechanical objects, electronic devices, or software, although the methodology and techniques involved in each type of analysis differ widely.
12;DOS (DDOS) & Botnet;HIGH;MEDIUM;HIGH;MEDIUM;now();now();An adversary consumes the resources of a target by rapidly engaging in a large number of interactions with the target. This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in rate limiting or flow. When successful this attack prevents legitimate users from accessing the service and can cause the target to crash. This attack differs from resource depletion through leaks or allocations in that the latter attacks do not rely on the volume of requests made to the target but instead focus on manipulation of the target''s operations. The key factor in a DOS/DDOS attack is the number of requests the adversary can make in a given period of time. The greater this number, the more likely an attack is to succeed against a given target.
13;Distribution Manipulation;MEDIUM;HIGH;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;now();now();An attacker undermines the integrity of a product, software, or technology at some stage of the distribution channel. The core threat of modification or manipulation during distribution arise from the many stages of distribution, as a product may traverse multiple suppliers and integrators as the final asset is delivered. Components and services provided from a manufacturer to a supplier may be tampered with during integration or packaging.
14;Zero-Day;LOW;HIGH;HIGH;LOW;now();now();A zero-day (also known as 0-day) vulnerability is a computer-software vulnerability that is unknown to those who would be interested in mitigating the vulnerability (including the vendor of the target software). Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect computer programs, data, additional computers or a network. An exploit directed at a zero-day vulnerability is called a zero-day exploit, or zero-day attack.
15;Known Exploit;HIGH;MEDIUM;LOW;HIGH;now();now();Memory safety is the state of being protected from various software bugs and security vulnerabilities when dealing with memory access, such as buffer overflows. A buffer overflow occurs when data written to a buffer also corrupts data values in memory addresses adjacent to the destination buffer due to insufficient bounds checking. This can occur when copying data from one buffer to another without first checking that the data fits within the destination buffer.
16;Password Guessing;HIGH;LOW;LOW;HIGH;now();now();In this attack, some asset (information, functionality, identity, etc.) is protected by a finite secret value. The attacker attempts to gain access to this asset by using trial-and-error to exhaustively explore all the possible secret values in the hope of finding the secret (or a value that is functionally equivalent) that will unlock the asset. Examples of secrets can include, but are not limited to, passwords, encryption keys, database lookup keys, and initial values to one-way functions.
17;Web App Attacks;HIGH;LOW;LOW;HIGH;now();now();Web based attacks are those that make use of web-enabled systems and services such as browsers (and their extensions), websites (including Content Management Systems), and the IT-components of web services and web applications. Examples of such attacks include web browser exploits (or their extensions), web servers and web services exploits, drive-by attacks, water holing attacks, redirection and man-in-the-browser-attacks. This type of attack remained one of the most important threats in 2017 and is expected to stay so in the coming years, given the fact that web technologies and web components are of high importance in the digital world. Web-based attacks are very popular in combination with malware campaigns for infection, propagation or victims control purposes, banking malware being a relevant example in this sense. Web-based-attacks have shown a substantial increase in 2017 and are about to reach levels similar to malware (in number of detected appearances).
18;Persistence;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;now();now();Operating system allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or users logon to a system. If adversaries can access these scripts, they may insert additional code into the logon script. This code can allow them to maintain persistence or move laterally within an enclave because it is executed every time the affected user or users logon to a computer.
19;Ransomwere;HIGH;HIGH;HIGH;MEDIUM;now();now();Ransomware depicts a type of malware (like Viruses, Trojans, etc.) that infect the computer systems of users and manipulates the infected system in a way, that the victim cannot (partially or fully) use it and the data stored on it. The victim usually shortly after receives a blackmail note by pop-up, pressing the victim to pay a ransom (hence the name) to regain full access to system and files.
20;Post-Exploitation Activities;MEDIUM;HIGH;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;now();now();Post-exploitation activities are the phases of operation once a victim''s system has been compromised by the attacker. The value of the compromised system is determined by the value of the actual data stored in it and how an attacker may make use of it for malicious purposes. The concept of post exploitation has risen from this fact only as to how you can use the victim''s compromised system''s information. This phase actually deals with collecting sensitive information, documenting it, and having an idea of the configuration settings, network interfaces, and other communication channels. These may be used to maintain persistent access to the system as per the attacker''s needs. The various phases of post-exploitation are as follows: • Privilege escalation, • Lateral Movement, • Traffic interception/Manipulation, • Cleaning tracks, • Collecting system information and data, • Setting up backdooring and rootkits
21;Physical Information Gathering;LOW;LOW;LOW;MEDIUM;now();now();There are a variety of physical methods for information gathering. Some require very little equipment and others involve high-tech gear to properly pull them off. The one thing these methods have in common is that they cannot be done from a remote location. You have to be on-site and in-person. This means that pretexting, the principles of influence and other psychological factors are typically necessary to successfully utilize these methods. No one source of information is the leading method to use nor is one method alone likely to give you enough data to secure your best chances for success. Your best bet, and the route many criminals will take, is to utilize multiple methods of gathering information and then synthesize the proper attack vector for the job from that data.
22;Physical Theft;MEDIUM;LOW;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;now();now();An adversary gains physical access to a system or device through theft of the item. Possession of a system or device enables a number of unique attacks to be executed and often provides the adversary with an extended timeframe for which to perform an attack. Most protections put in place to secure sensitive information can be defeated when an adversary has physical access and enough time.
23;Unauthorized Item Dropping;LOW;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;LOW_MEDIUM;now();now();An example of Dropping Unauthorized Device is the “Human Interface Device Attack” (HID) or a “USB Drive-by”. The HID attack is a scenario in which an attacker takes a programmable embedded development platform such as the Teensy 3.2 (pictured above), and an associated software package such as Peensy or the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) and creates a USB device which when plugged into a computer will execute a pre-configured set of keystrokes to drop a malicious payload onto the target computer. The actual payloads that are dropped and executed are highly configurable and this approach will work on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
24;Dangerous Item Dropping;LOW;HIGH;HIGH;LOW;now();now();The attacker sends a dangerous items, like a bomb or anthrax letter, to the target.
25;Physycal Security Bypassing;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;now();now();Facilities often used layered models for physical security such as traditional locks, Electronic-based card entry systems, coupled with physical alarms. Hardware security mechanisms range from the use of computer case and cable locks as well as RFID tags for tracking computer assets. This layered approach makes it difficult for random physical security breaches to go unnoticed, but is less effective at stopping deliberate and carefully planned break-ins. Avoiding detection begins with evading building security and surveillance and methods for bypassing the electronic or physical locks which secure entry points.
26;Device Manipulation;LOW;MEDIUM;MEDIUM;LOW_MEDIUM;now();now();Attack patterns within this category focus on the adversary''s ability to manipulate one or more resources in order to achieve a desired outcome. (CAPEC) An example of Device Manipulation is where an attacker install an owner device (like a Raspberry Pi or Arduino) inside a SCADA device with the aim of intercept/analyse, manipulate the data or destroy the device.
