Examples of such attacks include web browser exploits (or their extensions), web servers and web services exploits, drive-by attacks, water holing attacks, redirection and man-in-the-browser-attacks. This type of attack remained one of the most important threats in 2017 and is expected to stay so in the coming years, given the fact that web technologies and web components are of high importance in the digital world. Web-based attacks are very popular in combination with malware campaigns for infection, propagation or victims control purposes, banking malware being a relevant example in this sense. Web-based-attacks have shown a substantial increase in 2017 and are about to reach levels similar to malware (in number of detected appearances).",

The value of the compromised system is determined by the value of the actual data stored in it and how an attacker may make use of it for malicious purposes. The concept of post exploitation has risen from this fact only as to how you can use the victim's compromised system's information. This phase actually deals with collecting sensitive information, documenting it, and having an idea of the configuration settings, network interfaces, and other communication channels. These may be used to maintain persistent access to the system as per the attacker's needs. The various phases of post-exploitation are as follows: • Privilege escalation, • Lateral Movement, • Traffic interception/Manipulation, • Cleaning tracks, • Collecting system information and data, • Setting up backdooring and rootkits",

The value of the compromised system is determined by the value of the actual data stored in it and how an attacker may make use of it for malicious purposes. The concept of post exploitation has risen from this fact only as to how you can use the victim's compromised system's information. This phase actually deals with collecting sensitive information, documenting it, and having an idea of the configuration settings, network interfaces, and other communication channels. These may be used to maintain persistent access to the system as per the attacker's needs. The various phases of post-exploitation are as follows: • Privilege escalation, • Lateral Movement, • Traffic interception/Manipulation, • Cleaning tracks, • Collecting system information and data, • Setting up backdooring and rootkits",

The concept of post exploitation has risen from this fact only as to how you can use the victim's compromised system's information. This phase actually deals with collecting sensitive information, documenting it, and having an idea of the configuration settings, network interfaces, and other communication channels. These may be used to maintain persistent access to the system as per the attacker's needs. The various phases of post-exploitation are as follows: • Privilege escalation, • Lateral Movement, • Traffic interception/Manipulation, • Cleaning tracks, • Collecting system information and data, • Setting up backdooring and rootkits",

Examples of such attacks include web browser exploits (or their extensions), web servers and web services exploits, drive-by attacks, water holing attacks, redirection and man-in-the-browser-attacks. This type of attack remained one of the most important threats in 2017 and is expected to stay so in the coming years, given the fact that web technologies and web components are of high importance in the digital world. Web-based attacks are very popular in combination with malware campaigns for infection, propagation or victims control purposes, banking malware being a relevant example in this sense. Web-based-attacks have shown a substantial increase in 2017 and are about to reach levels similar to malware (in number of detected appearances).",

The concept of post exploitation has risen from this fact only as to how you can use the victim's compromised system's information. This phase actually deals with collecting sensitive information, documenting it, and having an idea of the configuration settings, network interfaces, and other communication channels. These may be used to maintain persistent access to the system as per the attacker's needs. The various phases of post-exploitation are as follows: • Privilege escalation, • Lateral Movement, • Traffic interception/Manipulation, • Cleaning tracks, • Collecting system information and data, • Setting up backdooring and rootkits",

This type of attack remained one of the most important threats in 2017 and is expected to stay so in the coming years, given the fact that web technologies and web components are of high importance in the digital world. Web-based attacks are very popular in combination with malware campaigns for infection, propagation or victims control purposes, banking malware being a relevant example in this sense. Web-based-attacks have shown a substantial increase in 2017 and are about to reach levels similar to malware (in number of detected appearances).",

The concept of post exploitation has risen from this fact only as to how you can use the victim's compromised system's information. This phase actually deals with collecting sensitive information, documenting it, and having an idea of the configuration settings, network interfaces, and other communication channels. These may be used to maintain persistent access to the system as per the attacker's needs. The various phases of post-exploitation are as follows: • Privilege escalation, • Lateral Movement, • Traffic interception/Manipulation, • Cleaning tracks, • Collecting system information and data, • Setting up backdooring and rootkits",

The concept of post exploitation has risen from this fact only as to how you can use the victim's compromised system's information. This phase actually deals with collecting sensitive information, documenting it, and having an idea of the configuration settings, network interfaces, and other communication channels. These may be used to maintain persistent access to the system as per the attacker's needs. The various phases of post-exploitation are as follows: • Privilege escalation, • Lateral Movement, • Traffic interception/Manipulation, • Cleaning tracks, • Collecting system information and data, • Setting up backdooring and rootkits",

The concept of post exploitation has risen from this fact only as to how you can use the victim's compromised system's information. This phase actually deals with collecting sensitive information, documenting it, and having an idea of the configuration settings, network interfaces, and other communication channels. These may be used to maintain persistent access to the system as per the attacker's needs. The various phases of post-exploitation are as follows: • Privilege escalation, • Lateral Movement, • Traffic interception/Manipulation, • Cleaning tracks, • Collecting system information and data, • Setting up backdooring and rootkits",
